##PROJECT 1: CLOUSEAU
> Weeks 1-3  

In the first week students get familiar with Pandas for doing
data analysis. We provide the data and students begin to use
Python and Pandas to run analyses. In the second week students
learn how to scrape webpages to acquire data for their analysis.
We will guide students on how to create a PDF report and plotting
so they can focus on brainstorming and telling a story in their
PDF report.

##PROJECT 2: FLETCHER
> Weeks 4-7

Here we dive deep into databases (SQL and NoSQL) and how Python
can interact with them. We will work with flatfiles, JSON data, and 
REST apis. During these weeks students will acquire data from Twitter, 
store this data in a database of their choosing, and create a public
dashboard using Plotly.

##PROJECT 3: HOLMES
> Weeks 8-10

For their final project students are free to use any of the tools and techniques we've covered in class, or use something new. Each student works intensely to create something awesome, new, interesting, or useful.
